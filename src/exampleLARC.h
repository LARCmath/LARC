 * \brief A function which uses apply_function_to_matrix_values to square
 * each element of a matrix
 *
 * The function takes as input a packedID for a matrix A, and generates a new
 * matrix B whose elements B_{ij} = |A_{ij}|^2. The new matrix is added to the
 * matrixStore and its matrixID returned.
 *
 * \param input_pID The packedID of the matrix whose elements are to be squared
 * \param op_memz One of the operation types FUNC_A, FUNC_B, ... left available for memoizing user-defined functions
 * \result The packedID of the new matrix
