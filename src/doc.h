There is a set of slides in the doc file "about_LARC_2017.pdf"
which describing the ideas behind LARC. 

The acknowledgment section of the slides states:

We are grateful to the many people who helped with us develop
LARC by participating in discussions, testing existing code, 
adding additional capabilities, helping create
the python SWIG wrapper, and working on applications 
which utilize LARC as a math library.

These people include:
Matt Calef, Bill Carlson, John Fregeau, Lisa Jones,
Larry Hiller, James Howse, JKK, Steve Kratzer, 
Laurie Law, Van Molino, Mark Motley, Mark Pleszkoch, 
Michael Schneider, Doug Shors, Michelle Snider, 
and Andy Wills.

Thank you!
