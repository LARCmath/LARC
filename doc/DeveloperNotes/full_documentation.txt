This document discusses the documentation available in LARC
===========================================================

Our intent is that every function in LARC will have comments providing Doxygen
documentation. However, we have intentionally limited the HTML documentation
that is visible to the casual user of LARC to those routines which can be
called safely from Python code. This means that by default the documentation
for C routines which do not have SWIG wrappers is not shown. These routines
generally work with pointers to structures, including scalarType variables (as
multiprecision types are implemented as pointers) and pointers to matrices in
the matrixStore.

This does not mean that documentation is not available. Developers that want
HTML documentation to be produced for these routines need to modify two lines
in MyPyLARC/LARC/src/Doxyfile.in. The lines that begin with EXCLUDE_PATTERNS
and EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS may be commented out to have access to all documentation in
LARC. For many developers, this will produce more documentation than is needed,
and they may wish to instead edit the exclusion lists to give them only the
documentation that they need.
